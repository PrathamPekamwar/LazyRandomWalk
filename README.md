# Mixing Time of Lazy Random Walks on Monotone Subsets of Hypercubes.
- Studied mixing times in lazy random walk on monotone subsets of hypercubes, providing a literature survey, simulation study and few results with the aim to establish a foundation for future research towards proving a better upper bound on the mixing time of lazy random walks within these structures.
